		<blockquote>"In 1998, the Father of Strengths Psychology, Donald O. Clifton, Ph.D. (1924-2003), along with Tom Rath and a team of scientists at Gallup, created the online StrengthsFinder assessment. In 2004, the assessment's name was formally changed to "Clifton StrengthsFinder" in honor of its chief designer. In 2007, building on the initial assessment and language from StrengthsFinder 1.0, Rath and Gallup scientists released a new edition of the assessment, program, and website, dubbed "StrengthsFinder 2.0." Rooted in more than 40 years of research, this assessment has helped millions discover and develop their natural talents."<br>

		<h2>My Top Six Strengths</h2>
		
		The following is an excerpt from my personalized report from StrengthsFinder 2.0. The explanation is tailored to my personal style and strengths. People with similar strengths will not have the same explanation of each strength. Again, this is extremely personalized and I have found that each description is rather accurate in describing my personality.

		<h3>Command</h3>

		<p>Instinctively, you quiet outspoken people with your quick and clever thinking. You rely on facts and reason to support your ideas.

What you say and how you say it can even frighten and threaten people. You probably have used this effect to influence individuals to do what you want. Driven by your talents, you are industrious, diligent, and persistent. You naturally set difficult-to-reach goals. These normally demand a great amount of your time. While your work ethic is evident, you question whether the promotions, titles, opportunities, or status symbols you desire could exact too high a price. Chances are good that you are more comfortable talking about ideas than issuing orders or dealing with conflict. You gravitate to conversations with intelligent people. You intentionally cast aside emotions and concentrate on the facts. You continually search for evidence to make your points and wish others would do the same.</p>
