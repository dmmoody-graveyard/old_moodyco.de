	<h2>Personal Manifesto</h2>
		<p>"I swear by my life and my love of it that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine." - John Galt, <i>Atlas Shrugged</i></p>
		<p>In any situation, regardless of how difficult it may be, I will exhibit strength and control. I will display the courage to stand steadfast in my principles, even in the face of impossible circumstances. I will take the words of Alexandre Dumas in the novel <i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i>  to heart.</p>
		<blockquote>"Life is a storm, my young friend. You will bask in the sunlight one moment, be shattered on the rocks the next. What makes you a man is what you do when that storm comes."</blockquote>
		<p>I will always do more than I am paid for to invest in my future.</p>
		<p>I will speak with integrity and only say what I mean.</p>
		<p>I will remain immune to the opinions and actions of others; I will not accept needless suffering as a victim. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality and not mine.</p>
		<p>I will communicate with others as clearly as I am able to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama.</p>
		<p>I will ask questions and to express what I really want.</p>
		<p>I will always do my best. My best is going to change from moment to moment; it will differ from when I am healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, I will simply do my best, and I will avoid self-judgement, self-abuse, and regret.</p>
